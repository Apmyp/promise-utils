/**
 * Caches the results of an async function. When creating a hash to store function results against,
 * the callback is omitted from the hash and an optional hash function can be used.
 *
 * If no hash function is specified, the first argument is used as a hash key, which may work
 * reasonably if it is a string or a data type that converts to a distinct string. Note that objects
 * and arrays will not behave reasonably. Neither will cases where the other arguments are
 * significant. In such cases, specify your own hash function.
 *
 * @param {AsyncFunction} fn - The async function to proxy and cache results from.
 * @param {Function} hasher - An optional function for generating a custom hash for storing
 *     results. It has all the arguments applied to it and must be synchronous.
 * @returns a memoized version of fn
